# **Python Task: Operators**

## **Task Overview**

Welcome to your Python **Operators Task**\!

In this task, you'll dive deep into one of the core building blocks of Python called **Operators**. You'll practice working with different types of operators including **Arithmetic**, **Logical**, and **Comparison** operators. These operators are essential for performing calculations, making decisions, and building real-world Python programs.

By the end of this task, you’ll be able to:

* Use arithmetic operators to perform mathematical operations.

* Apply logical operators to combine multiple conditions.

* Compare values using comparison operators.

This task will strengthen your foundational knowledge of Python and prepare you for building more complex logic in your future coding projects.

## **Operators**

### **1\. Arithmetic Operators**

#### **Questions:**

1. What are arithmetic operators? Give 2 examples in your own words.  

2. Define below two variables and perform operations using arithmetic operators (+, \-, \*, /, //, %, \*\*).

| value1 \= 10value2 \= 15 |
| :---- |

   

* Add value1 and value2.  
* Subtract value1 from value2.  
* Multiply value1 and value2.  
* Divide value1 by value2.  
* Find the floor division of value1 by value2.  
* Find the remainder when dividing value1 by value2.  
* Calculate value1 raised to the power of value2.

**Challenge:**

You have a floor that is 95 meters long and 58.8 meter wide. Find out the **Total Area rectangular floor** using python and print it. 

	A rectangular tile is 2 meters long and 2 meters wide.   
How many such tiles will you need to cover the floor completely?

### **2\. Logical Operators**

#### **Questions:**

1. What are logical operators in Python? Where do we use them?  
2. Create a Python script that defines two boolean variables, is\_sunny and is\_warm, with appropriate values (True or False).  
3. Use logical operators (and, or, not) to create the following conditions:  
* Check if it's both sunny and warm and print the result.  
* Check if it's either sunny or warm and print the result.  
* Check if it's not sunny and print the result.

**Challenge:**

If **has\_umbrella \= True** and **is\_raining \= False**,  
Can you go outside without getting wet? Use logical operators to decide.

### **3\. Comparison Operators**

#### **Questions:**

1. What are comparison operators? List a few real-world situations where we use them.  
2. Create a Python script that defines two variables, value1 and value2, with any numeric values.  
3. Use comparative operators (==, \!=, \<, \>, \<=, \>=) to create the following conditions:  
1. Check if value1 is equal to value2 and print the result.  
2. Check if value1 is not equal to value2 and print the result.  
3. Check if value1 is less than value2 and print the result.  
4. Check if value1 is greater than value2 and print the result.  
5. Check if value1 is less than or equal to value2 and print the result.  
6. Check if value1 is greater than or equal to value2 and print the result.

**Challenge:**

A person’s age is **18**.  
Write a condition to check if the person is eligible to vote (18 or older). Print the message accordingly.

### **4\. CONCATENATION REPETITION**

#### **Questions:**

1. What is concatenation and what is repetition? Write the difference between them ?    
2. Take two variables as first\_name and last\_name.concatenate them.  
3. Print "Innomatics" 5 times in the same line.

**Challenge:**

Create a **mini banner** that Prints "**Welcome\!**" followed by your full name 3 times, each on a new line.

## 📚 What you will find here
Every day, I upload a new folder containing:  

1. **Concepts (`concepts.md`)**  
   Clear and simple explanations of the topics learned that day.  

2. **Tasks (`tasks.ipynb`)**  
   Practical exercises and examples in Python for hands-on learning.  

3. **Resources (`resources.md`)**  
   Links to tutorials, videos, blogs, and documentation to deepen your understanding.  

Example folder structure:
